# TruckerJobL
 A Truckerjob i did with a fellow newcomer,


this is a barebone minimum alpha-version of my truckerjob, its based on nativeui and yeah it has a few jobs i added in but nothing more <3



there is allot planned ;)
version 1.3 is here bois!
Leasing is now a thing! <3


Planed for the future is:

- Making that the Trucker gets - â‚¬ for damaging the truck
- Better Notify
- Bugfixes
- Better Leasing
- Hiring Workers that work for you
- Specialized-Work
- Turning it into a NUI instead of NativeUI
- Making the Selling work (selling your own truck and not selling all of them for the same $)
